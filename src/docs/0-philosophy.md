Flotilla is strongly opinionated about self-service for data science.

The core assumption is that you understand your work the best. Therefore, it is you who should own your work from end-to-end.

You don't need a data engineer to extract, transform, and load data for your work. You need Flotilla.

You don't need a data engineer to run a model training job. You need Flotilla.

You don't need a production engineer to run your recurring jobs or to access logs in case of problems. You need Flotilla.
