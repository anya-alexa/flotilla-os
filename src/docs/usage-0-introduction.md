Flotilla is a self-service framework that dramatically simplifies the process of defining and executing containerized jobs. This means you get to focus on the work you're doing rather than _how_ to do it.

Once deployed, Flotilla allows you to:

* Define containerized jobs by allowing you to specify exactly what command to run, what image to run that command in, and what resources that command needs to run
* Run any previously defined job and access its logs, status, and exit code
* View and edit job definitions with a flexible UI
* Run jobs and view execution history and logs within the UI
* Use the complete REST API for definitions, jobs, and logs to build your own custom workflows
