Flotilla is strongly opinionated about self-service for data science.

The core assumption is that you understand your work the best. Therefore, it is _you_ who should own your work from end-to-end. In other words, you shouldn't need to be a "production engineer" to run your jobs or to access logs in case of problems. Do this with Flotilla.
