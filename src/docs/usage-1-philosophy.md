## Philosophy

Flotilla is strongly opinionated about self-service for data science.

The core assumption is that you understand your work the best. Therefor, it is _you_ who should own your work from end-to-end.

* You shouldn't need to be a "data engineer" to extract, transform, and load data for your work. Run this work with Flotilla.

* You shouldn't need to be an "algorithms engineer" to run a model training job. Run this work with Flotilla.

* You shouldn't need to be a "production engineer" to run your production jobs or to access logs in case of problems. Do this with Flotilla.
